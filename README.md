# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore developing within an isomorphic environment. The project will serve as a source code view for the completed application being included within my portfolio.

Commenting within both the code and also describing the nature of commits will be crucial in maintaining a clear representation of the development process.

# Project Overview    
Tagged is a simple web application that allows a user to register / login and upload images from their device. Once uploaded, the user will be able to tag other registered users in their images using the editor provided.

All images will remain private exclusive to the user that uploaded them since the underlying functionality to include public and private galleries would not demand additional skills and therefore would not contribute anything substantial towards this project as a portfolio candidate.

Development will begin by establishing a basic stack environment and producing a "Hello World" test component using server-side rendering.  Once this is running, test driven development can begin.

An Agile Scrum management method will be deployed using [Taiga](https://tree.taiga.io/) with a new github branch being created at the completion of each Sprint Backlog.

The project will use Test Driven Development and testing will be carried out using [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) based on [this setup](http://12devsofxmas.co.uk/2015/12/day-2-testing-react-applications/). The testing process will adhere to the following guidelines.

- All tests will be written before the code they are testing is developed.   

>Each test will initially fail and then pass when the code it is testing has been completed successfully.   

- Code rot will be avoided by removing interdependencies between functions/features where possible.
- Tests should be simple and fast to run.
- Keep test descriptions clear enough that they can be used as documentation.
- The intent of code should be defined by what you are testing.
- Spike Solutions (prototypes) should be basic representations of a problem and used to fill in knowledge gaps prior to starting the TDD process on a task.

## Declarative TDD   
Test Driven Development (TDD) is based on tests that are used to define the final product by testing **how a task should run**. This typically requires one or more additional steps that can be merged together if a Declarative approach is taken.

Declarative TDD is best demonstrated in the following short case study.

**Task**   
Build a Display Component that toggles visibility of a Rectangle by clicking a button.

**Imperative TDD Approach**   
- **Linear Step :** Map involved elements to complete the Task   

>Work out how many properties and functions are needed for the test by working through the sub-tasks step-by-step.   

- Create a test for the toggle function
- Build the toggle function to pass the test
- Pass props to the display component
- Create the display component with a button, container and child div elements using the props names passed in from the functional code being tested.
- Use CSS to shape the rectangle that will show/hide and style the button etc.

**Declarative TDD Approach**
- **Linear Step :** Create the display component with a button, container and child div elements.   

>Props required are defined in this step for onClick and CSS Display values.   

- Use CSS to shape the rectangle that will show/hide and style the button etc.
- Create a test for the toggle function
- Build the toggle function to pass the test
- Pass props to the display component

**Summary**   
Both approaches require an initial linear step that all consecutive steps have a dependency on.  The benefits of the Declarative approach are :
- A simplified development process, that combines the Imperative sub-task of producing a roadmap into the Declarative construction of the display component.   

>It is declarative because it is defining what the end result will look like in a declarative manner instead of using a Step-by-Step process to explain what needs to happen to reach this result.   

- It is more robust to changes because the roadmap and display component are one in the same thing.   

>Any change made to the display component is the equivalent of re-working the entire roadmap to include a change with cascading effects automatically factored into the equation.

Declarative TDD is still dynamic enough that additional, unknown props and content can be added to the "dumb" Display components any time and then tests can be produced.

## Primary Modules Used
The following list of modules is not exhaustive but will provide a quick overview of notable API's used in the development of Tagged.

- Webpack
- React (views)
- React-Router (routing views)
- SASS via PostCSS (precss plugin for advanced CSS using the SCSS syntax)
- Babel-Loader (transpiling)
- Mobservable (state management)
- ExpressJS (node.js server)
- Passport (social authentication)
- PG-Promise (db queries for postgreSQL)
- Dotenv (managing environment variables)

## Wireframe Layout and Style Guide
#### Wireframes
Below are the wireframe mock-ups for the layout of application views.   

<img src='public/images/home-view-wireframe.jpg'/>
<br/><br/>

- - -
<br/>
<img src='public/images/gallery-view-wireframe.jpg'/>
<br/><br/>

- - -
<br/>
<img src='public/images/editor-view-wireframe.jpg'/>
<br/><br/>

Include a toggle button in the Details area to Hide/Show Tags with Tags off by default.  This will be a universal toggle so it will remember the individual user setting and apply it to all images displayed in the Editor View.   

Footer and Sidebar panels should be collapsible or shrinkable by the end user with state being saved.

#### Style Guide
**Font Family**   
Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif   

**Colours**   
Logo Blue = rgba(0, 125, 241, 1)   
Sky Blue = rgba(180, 213, 242, 1)   
Navy = rgba(0, 12, 77, 1)   
Ice Blue = rgba(236, 248, 255, 1)   

**Other**   
A margin of 5px should be maintained between DOM elements where practicable.

## Release Backlog    
Tagged will be constructed from the following key components and User Stories (features listed as dot-points).

#### Heading
- Login and logout versions
- Tagged logo
- Authentication sub-components
- Additional information shared by all views
- Navigation bar when logged in

#### Home
- Basic information about Tagged
- Login and logout versions
- Logout version contains user statistics (images in gallery, number of times the user has been Tagged)

#### Gallery
- Private thumbnail image gallery
- Add and Remove images
- Click an image to open in the full editor

#### Editor
- Add, delete and modify tagged users in images
- Rename images
- Toggle tag visibility

# Sprint Backlogs
Completion of the following Sprint Backlogs will signify the finalisation of this project.

1. Create display components (dumb)
2. Style display components (tweak DOM elements as needed)
3. Establish routing and view components
4. Configure passport for social login
5. Configure postgreSQL database tables
6. Configure session management
7. Create view logic components (smart)

The order of these Sprint Backlogs is subject to change depending on requirements of specific modules to ensure testing is complete.

**Tests for Logic (smart) Components**   
The following tests will be slightly different when working with Mobservable to Redux (they were initially designed for redux).
- The rendering of a React component given a particular state
- The behaviour of a React component and how it affects the state via dispatched actions.
- The state or the application (the default values and how it changes with to subscribed actions)

Sprint Backlogs will be documented in the [Sprint Backlog Summaries](#sprint-backlog-summaries) which are divided into 2 stages; **Pre-Development** and **Post-Development**.

The Pre-Development stage will provide a rundown of each User Story being completed during a Sprint.  User Stories will be defined as Tasks and Sub-Tasks, designed to suit a test driven development process.

The Post-Development stage will review any obstacles or changes that occurred during development. A brief summary will wrap up each Milestone detailing any differences between the Burndown Velocity and the Estimated Completion Date, plus what actions will be taken to keep the project on track.

## Sprint Backlog Summaries

#### Display Components
Display components are the React components that rely on inherited props to enable interactivity and have no knowledge of the store. These components define the CSS styling and DOM element structure.

Declarative TDD will use each Display Component as the framework for reference purposes when developing the automatic tests in future Sprint Backlogs.

##### Display Components Pre-Development
Below is a list of User Stories broken down into Tasks and Sub-Tasks that will be completed during this Sprint.

>Spike Solutions will need to be developed in order to complete the commented sub-tasks.

* **Heading Display Components**
  - Login
  - Logout
  - Navigation Bar
  - Logo
* **Home Display Components**
  - Home Login Body
  - Home Logout Body
* **Gallery Display Components**
  - Gallery Image
  >*Missing props to handle checkbox related functions & onClick function if the image is clicked on to go to the Editor View*   

  - Gallery Body   
  >*run galleryImgList.map() in the gallery-body-view.jsx render() function, and have the callback function passed to map() return a child component element.(edited)  will result in an array proptype*   

  - Gallery Footer
* **Editor Display Components**
  - Editor Sidebar
  - Editor Body
  - Editor Footer

##### Display Components Post-Development
Post-Development notes regarding Display Components will be listed in this section of the document and describe changes that were made to the originally proposed layout or Spike Solutions that were produced as part of the development process.   

<svg height="12pt"><text fill="#007df1" font-size="12pt" font-weight="bold" x="0" y="12">Spike Solutions</text></svg>   
The following Spike Solutions were produced in order to solve PropType and DOM Element Structure problems.

**Problem**   
Generate unique instances of a React component and insert them into another component programmatically.

**Solution**   
- Retrieve unique information as an array and use the map() function to cycle through each array element.
